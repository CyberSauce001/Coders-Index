# Coders-Index


Website : http://codersindex.com/

Summary: This is to practice my C++ coding, just for fun and to improve my coding skills. Later on, I will optimize it and make it better
There are currently no solution to this or have yet to be found. So this is my own take on it. There can be errors, so if you are 
using this for yourself remember that it can/can't be 100% correct.

Initial: Finish Each coding challenge
Mid: Update and optimize when time available
Final: Code in a different language that output the same thing
